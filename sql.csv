They get the tickets to The Quidditch World Cup Final but after the match is over, people dressed like Lord Voldemort's 'Death Eaters' set a fire to all the visitors' tents, coupled with the appearance of Voldemort's symbol, the 'Dark Mark' in the sky, which causes a frenzy across the magical community. That same year, Hogwarts is hosting 'The Triwizard Tournament', a magical tournament between three well-known schools of magic : Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. The contestants have to be above the age of 17, and are chosen by a magical object called Goblet of Fire.

Since the magic cannot be reversed, Harry is forced to go with it and brave three exceedingly difficult tasks.;https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTI1NDMyMjExOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwOTc4MjQzMQ@@._V1_SX300.jpg;RX6,SDDS;https://i.imgur.com/i3aD05u.png,https://i.imgur.com/ABinULO.gif,https://i.imgur.com/Wflfyct.gif;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire
